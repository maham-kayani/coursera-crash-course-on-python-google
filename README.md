| Python Programming Syntax and Semantics       | Python follows syntax rules for instructions and has defined semantics for their effects.  |
| Python as a Scripting Language for Automation  | Python is widely used as a scripting language to automate tasks and perform repetitive jobs. |
| Python Interpreter                            | The Python interpreter reads and executes the code, enabling program execution.             |
