About simple programs and understanding of their role in automation
some important concepts
-->Python programming has syntax(Rules for instructions) and semantics(effect of the instructions)
-->Python as a scripting language for automation
-->python interpreter: read and run the code
Week	Topics	Description
1	Basic Print Statement, Arithmetic Operators	Introducing basic printing of text and numbers, performing basic arithmetic operations like +, -, *, /, %, etc.
2	Data Types, Conditional Statements	Exploring different data types (integers, strings, booleans) and using conditional statements (if, else)
3	Loops	Understanding loops as a way to repeat actions
- For Loops	Using 'for' loops to iterate over sequences of elements
- While Loops	Using 'while' loops to repeat actions until a condition changes
- Nested Loops	Employing loops within loops for more complex iterations
4	Dictionary, Tuple, List, List Comprehension	Introducing data structures like dictionaries, tuples, and lists, along with list comprehensions
